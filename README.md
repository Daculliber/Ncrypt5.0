# Ncrypt5.0
A little and easy to use CLI encryption program.
It is based on cryptography found at 'https://cryptography.io/' which you need to install for yourself.
It has a text encryprion mode and a file encryption mode.
It has a built in file explorer.
In the windows and linux folders you will find the source code, and in the exe folder you will find them as executables for both windows and linux
They were compiled with pyinstaller 'https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/'. The one for linux mingt not work on some distros.
I hope you will find this program useful.
