# Ncrypt5.1
A little and easy to use CLI encryption program.

>> It is based on cryptography found at 'https://cryptography.io/' which you need to install for yourself.
>> It has a text encryprion mode and a file encryption mode.
>> It has a built in file explorer.

In the 'windows' and 'linux' folders you will find the source code for each OS.
I hope you will find this program useful.
