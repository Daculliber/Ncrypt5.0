# Ncrypt5.1
A little and easy to use CLI encryption program.

>> It is based on cryptography found at 'https://cryptography.io/' which you need to install for yourself.
>> It has a text encryprion mode and a file encryption mode.
>> It has a built in file explorer.

UPDATE:
>> The PIN algorythm was made more secure and might even destroy the file if it's incorrect. Still don't rely on it. A script kiddie can hack it in 5 minutes.
   The key is the security. Keep it safe.
>> The interface was changed a little bit and the file explorer will now show what are you doing.
>> I did not add any executables, because on linux, it won't work with each distro, and making your own is easy enough.
   I removed the old ones because of security issues.
In the 'windows' and 'linux' folders you will find the source code for each OS.
I hope you will find this program useful.
